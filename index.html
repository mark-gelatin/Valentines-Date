                    <h1>To my Beloved,</h1> <br>
                    <p>For my love, strength, weakness, fear, and confidence—I ask you to be my Valentine. For a long time, I have been asking myself the question, “Why do I love this woman?” and I keep answering, “You just do.” Even tonight, I still cannot fully explain why I love you or how much I love you, because to me, it is immeasurable and indescribable. Loving you has been my last rope in this life—and I don’t mean that in a suicidal way—but I want you to know that without you, I don’t know where I would find myself.
                    <br> <br>
                    My only wish is to be with you, to be your Valentine, and to be the one you can always count on. I want to be the one who makes you smile, who makes you laugh, who makes you feel loved and appreciated every single day. I want to be the one who supports you through thick and thin, who stands by your side no matter what life throws at us. I want to be the one who shares all of life's joys and sorrows with you, because I know that together we can conquer anything.
                    <br> <br>
                    In the years we’ve been together, I have genuinely cared and cherished every moment, every day, every second with you. I love you always, Mon. Please always stay with me, no matter what. I promise to be there for you, especially when you need me the most. So tonight, I ask you the biggest question: Would you still be my Valentine through hardships, stressful days and nights, or even the times when it might feel easier not to choose me? If you asked me the same question, my answer would be: “No matter the condition, I will always ask you to be my Valentine,” praying that you answer the same.
                    <br> <br>
                    This is a small message, but I hope it finds you exactly when you need it.</p>
